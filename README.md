I created this console game based on a Polish game called 'The Wheel of Fortune'.
You can find the rules on the Internet. 
The code is written in C++ with the basics of OOP, but it is not small because I had to rewrite the code from my teacher. 
He provided code without OOP, and he asked me to remake it, so I didn't spend a lot of time optimizing the code. 
My primary focus was to transfer this code into OOP standards
